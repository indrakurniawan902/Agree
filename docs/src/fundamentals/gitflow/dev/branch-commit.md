# Branch and Commit

## Branch naming

Branch naming should be started with the type of branch, e.g:

- feature-home
- bugfix-register
- hotfix-login

## Commit Message

Commit message must be concise and clear and followed by backlog code:

- "add feature login #AGR-001"
- "bugfix feature register #AGR-002"
- "hotfix feature login #AGR-001"
